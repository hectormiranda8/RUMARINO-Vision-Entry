# RUMARINO-Vision-Entry
A RUMARINO VISION entry challenge.

Hector A. Miranda Sanchez

# What I have added
I have added a main.py file to run the script by itself. DO NOTE that you have to change a variable path (the darknet path) for it to run.
I have indicated in my code exactly where to change it (inside the main.py).
